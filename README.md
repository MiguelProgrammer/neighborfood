Through the monolith, I will create an application similar to Ifood.

This application is being developed to prove theories, software development with DDD, every flow developed here is intended only to put into technical practices of domais driven design, I will use docker to upload the application to the PostgreSql database.

We will apply the techniques to a monolith pattern to understand in practice the importance of clean architectural design beyond project patterns.

We know that exagonal architecture preaches business agnostic to frameworks and technologies, however, I use the benefit of spring to completely create this project and in the end I will decouple it from the technologies used.

Thinking in a pragmatic way, I see this definition of exagonal architecture as at least indifferent, think about it, it preaches the non-relationship with the technology used but depends on others for its purpose to be served, it's a kind of I want you here, but even give me help. LOL
